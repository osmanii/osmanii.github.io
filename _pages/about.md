Dr. Md Osman Gani is an Assistant Professor of Information Systems at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), where he directs the Causal AI Lab. He is also a faculty affiliate in the Computer Science and Electrical Enginnering at UMBC.

His research interests are in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), with a significant emphasis on advancing methods that move beyond correlation to uncover causal relationships and estimate causal effects. 

His research develops data-driven and knowledge-guided causal AI methods that improve causal discovery, inference, and effect estimation from complex and biased observational data. He applies these advances to pressing challenges in healthcare (e.g., treatment effect estimation from EHR data), climate science (e.g., modeling ice sheet melt and sea-level rise), natural language processing (e.g., hallucination detection in large language models), and rehabilitation engineering (e.g., personalized accessible navigation for wheelchair users). His work combines causal modeling, statistics, and machine learning to accelerate scientific discovery, inform policy decisions, and design technologies that positively impact society. His research has been supported by the NSF, NIH, and NIDILRR, including multi-million-dollar NSF Harnessing Data Revolution (HDR) - iHARP.

Dr. Gani received his doctorate in Computational Sciences at Marquette University in 2017, where his dissertation focused on the development of a novel framework to recognize complex human activity to achieve context-awareness. He received his B.Sc. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Military Institute of Science and Technology (MIST), Bangladesh and M.Sc. degree in Computational Sciences from Marquette University, USA. Before joining UMBC, he was a Visiting Assistant Professor at Miami University where he co-lead a research group, SMART (Social Mobile Assisted Real-Time) Systems Research Group.
