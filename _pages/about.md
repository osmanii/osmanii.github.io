I am an Assistant Professor of Information Systems at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). I lead the Causal AI Lab at UMBC. I am also a faculty affiliate for research in the Regenstreif Center for Healthcare Engineering at Purdue University.

My research interests are in machine learning and artificial intelligence, with a growing emphasis on causality and its application in various domains including ubiquitous computing, healthcare, natural language processing (NLP), rehabilitation engineering, and climate change. I received my doctorate in Computational Sciences at Marquette University in 2017, where I established my research in mathematical modeling, machine learning, ubiquitous computing, and mobile health. My Ph.D. dissertation focused on the development of a novel framework to recognize complex human activity to achieve context-awareness which heavily depends on the user location and simple human activity. I received my B.Sc. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Military Institute of Science and Technology (MIST), Bangladesh and M.Sc. degree in Computational Sciences from Marquette University, USA. I have worked on both localization and human activity recognition to develop ML-based methodologies which facilitate context-awareness. Before joining UMBC, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor at Miami University where I along with one of my colleagues established a research group, SMART (Social Mobile Assisted Real-Time) Systems Research Group. I worked on multiple research projects involving mathematical modeling, machine learning, and mobile computing systems. The foundation of my research has applied the knowledge from computer science, applied mathematics, and statistics.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
